# (Open)Subsonic API Wrapper For Dart

**opensubsonic_api.dart** is a wrapper for the [Subsonic API](https://www.subsonic.org/) in Dart, with additional support for [OpenSubsonic](https://opensubsonic.netlify.app/).

## Goals

This package focuses on music only; podcasts and videos have the lowest priority.

## Usage

### Installation

TODO

### Define SubsonicApi

```dart
final client = SubsonicApi(
  baseUrl: 'https://example.com', // or 'http://localhost:3000'
  auth: const SubsonicAuthModel(
    username: 'admin', // or any other username you use
    password: 'admin', // or your password
  ),
  debug: true,
);

final result = await client.api.getArtists();
print(result);
```

> **Note:**
> 
> `debug` is used to pass the password directly to the server, and it should be used for testing purposes only.
>
> The password can be either in clear text or hex-encoded with an "enc:" prefix. Since version 1.13.0, this should only be used for testing purposes. 
>
> When `debug` is set to `false`, the password will be hashed as `md5(salt + password)`, where `salt` is a random string generated by the API server.
>
> [See the API documentation](https://subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) for more information.
